# Overview

AI Workplace Digital Twin is an intelligent enterprise assistant that continuously observes workplace platforms such as:

- GitHub
- Jira
- Slack
- Google Calendar
- Gmail
- Notion
- PagerDuty
- Datadog
- Zendesk

Whenever an important workplace event occurs—such as a deployment failure, critical employee absence, production incident, or customer support spike—the system automatically analyzes the situation using specialized AI agents.

Each agent focuses on a specific department, while an Executive Agent combines all analyses into a company-wide report containing:

- Root Cause Analysis
- Business Impact Assessment
- Company Health Score
- Risk Assessment
- Recommended Actions

After user approval, an Action Agent executes the required tasks using MCP tools, such as:

- Create Jira tickets
- Send Slack notifications
- Schedule Google Calendar meetings
- Create Notion incident reports
- Send stakeholder emails

# AI Agents

## Monitoring Agent

### Responsibility

Detect workplace events and route incidents.

### Receives Events From

- GitHub
- PagerDuty
- Slack
- Google Calendar
- Zendesk

### Output

```json
{
  "type": "deployment_failure",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

---

## Engineering Agent

### Responsibility

Analyze technical incidents.

### Uses

- GitHub
- Jira
- PagerDuty
- Datadog

### Produces

- Root Cause
- Engineering Health
- Technical Risks
- Confidence Score

Example

```json
{
    "department":"Engineering",
    "health":63,
    "rootCause":"Database migration failed"
}
```

---

## Operations Agent

### Responsibility

Analyze workforce operations.

### Uses

- Slack
- Google Calendar
- Gmail
- Notion

### Produces

- Resource Availability
- Scheduling Risks
- Communication Issues

---

## Support Agent

### Responsibility

Analyze customer support.

        "Notify Engineering",
        "Delay Product Launch"
    ]
}
```

---

## Action Agent

### Responsibility

Execute approved enterprise actions.

### Uses MCP Tools

- github.rollback()
- jira.create_issue()
- slack.send_message()
- calendar.create_event()
- gmail.send_email()
- notion.create_page()

The Action Agent never makes decisions—it only executes the plan generated by the Executive Agent after user approval.

---

# MCP Integration

The project uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to interact with external enterprise platforms.

Instead of directly integrating every external REST API into the application, the Action Agent communicates with MCP servers exposing standardized tools.

Example tools include:

```text
github.get_deployment()

github.rollback()

github.get_pull_request()

jira.create_issue()

jira.update_issue()

slack.send_message()

calendar.create_event()

gmail.send_email()

notion.create_page()
```

This architecture keeps enterprise integrations modular, reusable, and MCP-compatible.

# Why AI Workplace Digital Twin?

Modern enterprises use dozens of disconnected workplace tools, making it difficult for teams to quickly understand incidents and coordinate responses.

AI Workplace Digital Twin acts as a centralized AI operations layer that continuously observes enterprise systems, correlates information across platforms, provides executive-level insights, and automates repetitive operational tasks through MCP-enabled enterprise integrations.
